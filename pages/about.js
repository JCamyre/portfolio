              Hey, I am a CS major at UCLA and a Full-Stack developer focusing
              on web development and mobile development! I am a Frontend Web Dev
              Intern for Viasat, where I will be building their component
              library for all of their websites and apps, where I will reach
              100,000s of Viasat customers.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm currently working at the CHIPS lab at UCLA maintaining,
              upgrading, and building new websites for them. I am also the Lead
              Frontend Developer and Project Manager for Yumie, a data
              aggregation and social media app targeted at college students. I
              assign tasks, help those who are running into issues, and do my
              best to make sure we reach our deadlines. We currently have a team
              of about 5 frontend engineers and about 20 people total.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am also a Dev Team Officer for ACM at UCLA, where I help
              coordinate events, assign tasks to other engineers, and help
              resolve issues within the team. I will be a Software Engineer
              after graduation, most likely specializing in Full-Stack or Mobile
              development. Interested in MANGA, Big N, Fintech, HFTs, and
              start-up companies.
